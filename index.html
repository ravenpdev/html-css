            <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
            <p>
              Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or
              artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike <a href="#">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called
              "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they
              navigate challenging sequences of moves.

            Experience the perfect blend of

          </p>
          <p>
            Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both
            <strong>accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts</strong>.
